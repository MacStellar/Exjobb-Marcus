## Abstract
The main purpose of this project is to investigate the possibility of creating trust between individuals on the internet. The emphasis on trust is crucial not only for online communication between organisations and their users but also for interactions between individuals, which this project will focus on. There are many scenarios where this trust is useful, including confirming identities of participants in online shopping to prevent fraud, verifying ages in gaming forums to combat grooming, and ensuring identity authenticity in online dating. Promoting the trust and prevention of fraud in these interactions motivates the development and analysis of an authentication system, designed to address both cybersecurity threats and ethical considerations.

It is not possible to integrate the OpenID connect authentication protocol directly as an intermediary in peer-2-peer interactions online. Consequently, the research objective is to explore whether establishing trust in peer-to-peer interactions online can be achieved securely and effectively by employing the OpenID Connect protocol in other ways. The project will start with building a demonstration web application for authentication with the React framework, designed for the company Truid. This web app will then be integrated with Truid’s existing services and OpenID connect for authentication. Following the implementation, a security analysis will be performed with a focus on trust and fraud prevention, covering a range of cybersecurity threats. The final phase involves analysing the results from an ethical and societal perspective.

## 1. Introduction
## 2. Background
Truid is a company which believes that trust is foundational for building a good society where you do not have to choose between freedom and security. They let you create a secure digital identity on their app with a self-managed Identity Wallet that enables authentication between users and organisations over OpenID Connect (OIDC) - supporting use cases such as Identity Proofing, Login and Signing. OIDC is designed for authenticating an individual for an organisation which makes it hard to directly integrate into peer-2-peer interactions. Therefore, this project investigates if OIDC instead can be used for peer-2-peer authentication in other ways from a cybersecurity, societal and ethical perspective. This system will be built on top of the Truid identity platform (SSI IdP and Identity Wallet) to ensure secure identity with user control and transparency.

The work will mainly be done in Truids office at Kungsgatan in Stockholm, where I will be spending my work days. The company will provide me with a personal Mac laptop with a previously set up digital environment. The prerequisites I have is knowledge gathered from courses in the university which covered web development (mainly in React), Secure Computer Systems, and ethical analysis. I also have volunteer experience from working with web development in React from my time as a system developer in Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students. I am also pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate in my free time, which is very relevant for this project. For learning the new systems and concepts at the company, the tools I’ll use will mainly be literature search, online learning and learning from experienced employees at the workplace. The report will be written parallel to the implementation work to offload later writing. A buffer time of 6 weeks for improvements is included in the time plan at the end.
## 3. Method
For learning the new systems and concepts at the company, the tools used will mainly be literature search, online learning and learning from experienced employees at the workplace. I will be spending as many working days at the company as possible, so there is always the possibility of getting help from experienced employees and my supervisor. Regarding web development, the React framework will be used. A Mac laptop belonging to the company will be used for working on the project, where an environment has been set up beforehand to contain the necessary programs and tools. For software development and version control, github will be used.

Results will be directly reflected upon and discussed with my supervisor at the company since we will work in close proximity. I will also insert my findings in the report every week to offload the writing process later on. The report will likely be a protected document which is also backed up somehow to protect from information loss. 

Personally, I will use a system containing the programs Todoist, Google calendar and Toggl, where Todoist is for keeping track of- and breaking down the tasks, Google calendar will be used to plan my time and Toggl is used to track time spent on the project (to verify for myself i fulfil my time goal of 40 hours a week).

### 3.1 Delimitations
The goal is not to create a product ready for production, but rather a proof of concept or demo. The security aspects will be limited to covering trust and fraud but if there is time, additional security aspects may be added. The focus is to create a working implementation and security analysis in good time, and then improve on it afterwards.
